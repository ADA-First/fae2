AInspector Utility Project

PROJECT DEPENDENCIES

The following libraries must be in the CLASSPATH:

* HTMLUnit version 2.8 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/htmlunit/)
* Apache Commons CLI 1.2 (http://commons.apache.org/cli/)

BUILD INFORMATION

* You will have to edit the classpath file after checking out the project
  in order to build AInspector.
* Once the classpath file has been updated, you can use the build script
  in the main project directory (e.g. trunk) to build the project:

  $ ./build

RUN INFORMATION

* Once you have built the project, to run it you first need to source the
  classpath file with:

  $ . org/ainspector/util/classpath

  Then you can run it from the ainspector-util subdirectory with:

  $ java org.ainspector.util.AInspector

* The command line options are as follows:

  -D,--debug            Optional: turn on debugging output
  -F,--filename <arg>   Required: text file with names of script files
  -U,--url <arg>        Required: URL to inspect
  -V,--verbose          Optional: turn on HtmlUnit logging output

USING THE INCLUDED TEST FILES

* Once you've built the project and set the runtime classpath (as above),
  you can run the included test files with:

  $ java org.ainspector.util.AInspector -F test/scripts.txt \
    -U http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net

* For convenience, there is also a run script that, by default, is set up
  to run the test scripts. You can run it with:

  $ ./run http://www.mydomain.com
