AInspector Utility Project

PROJECT DEPENDENCIES

The following libraries must be in the CLASSPATH:

* HTMLUnit version 2.9 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/htmlunit/)
* Apache Commons CLI 1.2 (http://commons.apache.org/cli/)

BUILD INFORMATION

* You will have to edit the classpath file after checking out the project
  in order to build AInspector.
* Once the classpath file has been updated, you can use the build script
  in the main project directory (i.e. trunk) to build the project:

  $ ./build

RUN INFORMATION

* Once you have built the project, to run it you first need to source the
  classpath file with:

  $ . org/ainspector/util/classpath

  Then you can run it from the main project directory with:

  $ java org.ainspector.util.AInspector --help

* The command line options are as follows:

  -s,--scripts <arg>   Required: file with names of script files
  -o,--output <arg     Required: output directory for saving results

  -i,--input <arg>     Required (unless --url): file with URLs to inspect
  -u,--url <arg>       Required (unless --input): single URL to inspect

  -D,--debug           Optional: turn on debugging output
  -V,--verbose         Optional: turn on HtmlUnit logging output

* Notes:
  1. The --output directory must not already exist.
  2. The --scripts and --input files must have one filename or URL per line;
     blank lines are ignored.
  3. Lines in the --input file that begin with # are considered comments and
     are ignored.
  4. When --debug is specified, all results are printed to the console and
     the --output directory is not created.

USING THE INCLUDED TEST FILES

* Once you've built the project and set the runtime classpath (as above),
  you can run the included test files with:

  $ java org.ainspector.util.AInspector -s test/scripts.txt \
    -u test/urls.txt -o tmp

* For convenience, there is also a run script that, by default, is set up
  to run the test scripts. It expects two arguments. You can run it with:

  $ ./run test/urls.txt /path/to/output/directory
