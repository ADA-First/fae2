<h2>Accessibility Evaluation of WCAG 2.0</h2>
<ul>
    
<li>The default rulesets used in the Functional Accessibility Evaluator 2.0 (FAE) 
    are based the requirements of the Level A and Level AA success criteria of the  
    <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a>.
</li>
<li>   
    The approach of FAE 2.0 is to support evaluation of not only accessibility, but also the usability of web resources by people 
    with disabilities through the use of accessible <em>design</em> technques and the use of the latest accessibility techniques 
    like the <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">W3C Accessible Rich Internet Accessibility Specification</a>.  
</li>  
<li>
    There are many potential techniques to meet the requirements of WCAG 2.0 and the 
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/">W3C WCAG 2.0 Techniques document</a> provides examples of some of the 
    techniques that can be used satisfy the requirements.
</li>
<li>
    Not all of the accessibility techniques tested by FAE 2.0 are included in the W3C WCAG 2.0 Techniques document, but the techniques 
    have been submitted to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">W3C WCAG techniques working group</a> for 
    consideration for inclusion. 
</li>    
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>Please be aware of the following limitations in the use of FAE:</p>

<ul>
    
    <li>While passing all of the FAE rules will generally provide highly accessible web pages,
        it should <strong>not</strong> be inferred from this that all accessibility requirements have been met. 
        We encourage you to become familiar with all accessibility requirements of WCAG 2.0 and 
        to be sure to implement them in your designs, including requirements that can only be 
        tested manually.</li>
    
    <li>FAE and its test components may not be able to interpret all markup; we recommend 
        that you validate your documents to improve the ability of FAE to intepret markup.</li>
    
    <li>If you are using accessibility techniques for conforming to WCAG 2.0 that are not identified in a ruleset, 
         this may result in not passing some of the rules used for evaluating accessibility.</li>
</ul>
