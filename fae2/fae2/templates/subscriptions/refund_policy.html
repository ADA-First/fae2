        <h2 id="id_refund">Refund Policy</h2>

        <p>There are <em>no</em> refunds on a paid subscription, so use the "Free" account type or a shorter term of subscription if you are unsure of your long term interest in FAE.  When a paid subscription is not renewed the subscription level will automatially return to the "Free" account type, which may result in losing archived and archived permanent reports.</p>
